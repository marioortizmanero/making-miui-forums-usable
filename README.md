Makes the MIUI forums usable: much less cluttered, bloated and ugly.

More specifically, this removes:
* Big medals
* Signatures
* More userdata under the profile
* Experience widget at the end of posts with the ratings
* Profile images
* Reduces margin between comments
* Annoying "Excellent" stamps
